Predicting Student Adaptability in Online Learning
This repository contains the implementation of the research project titled "Predicting Student Adaptability in Online Learning." The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the adaptability levels of students in online education based on various features such as Education Level, Institution Type, Gender, Age, Device, IT Student Status, Location, Financial Condition, Internet Type, Network Type, and Flexibility Level.

Introduction
The shift to online learning has created new challenges for students, particularly in terms of adaptability. This project seeks to address these challenges by using machine learning techniques to predict which students are likely to face difficulties in adapting to online learning environments. By identifying these students early, educational institutions can provide targeted support to improve their learning outcomes.

Project Structure

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Education Level: The current level of education of the student (e.g., undergraduate, postgraduate).
Institution Type: The type of educational institution (e.g., public, private).
Gender: The gender of the student.
Age: The age of the student.
Device: The primary device used for online learning (e.g., laptop, smartphone).
IT Student: Whether the student is an IT major or not.
Location: Geographic location of the student.
Financial Condition: The financial background of the student.
Internet Type: The type of internet connection (e.g., broadband, mobile data).
Network Type: The network type (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi).
Flexibility Level: A self-reported measure of how flexible the student feels they are in adapting to online learning.
